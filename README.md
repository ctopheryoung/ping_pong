## Description

This app accepts a number input by the user and counts to that number (1, 2, 3,.., etc) but the app prints "Ping" for multiples of 3, "Pong" for multiples of 5, and "PingPong" for multiples of 3 and 5. It is written in JavaScript and uses BDD and Red-Green-Refactor testing methods using Chai and Mocha.

## Specs:

* Will count from one to the number input by the user
* Will print "ping" instead of any number that is evenly divisible by 5
* Will print "pong' instead of any number that is evenly divisible by 5
* Will print "pingpong" instead of any number that is evenly divisible by 15
